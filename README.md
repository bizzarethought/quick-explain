## Technical Implementation

### Files Structure
- `manifest.json` - Extension manifest configuration
- `content.js` - Main extension logic and popup functionality
- `styles.css` - Styling for the popup and settings panel
- `test.html` - Test page for demonstrating functionality

### Key Components

#### Source Management
```javascript
const SOURCES = {
  auto: { label: 'Auto (Recommended)', description: '...', icon: '🤖' },
  wikipedia: { label: 'Wikipedia — Overview', description: '...', icon: '📚' },
  // ... others
};

const TONES = {
  friendly: { label: 'More Friendly', description: '...' },
  academic: { label: 'More Academic', description: '...' },
  poweruser: { label: 'Power-User / Advanced', description: '...' }
};
```

#### Data Fetching
The extension uses a modular approach to fetch data from different sources:
- `fetchData()` - Routes requests based on selected source
- Individual fetch functions for each data source
- Placeholder implementations that can be extended with real APIs

#### Settings Persistence
User preferences are stored locally using localStorage:
- `quickExplainSource` - Selected knowledge source
- `quickExplainTone` - Selected tone preference
- `quickExplainTheme` - Theme preference (light/dark)

## Customization

### Adding New Sources
1. Add the source to the `SOURCES` object in `content.js`
2. Create a corresponding fetch function
3. Update the `fetchData()` switch statement

### Adding New Tones
1. Add the tone to the `TONES` object in `content.js`
2. Update tone-based response formatting as needed

### Styling
The CSS uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:
```css
:root {
  --qe-bg: #fff;
  --qe-color: #111;
  --qe-border: rgba(0,0,0,0.12);
}
```

## Browser Compatibility

This extension is built with Manifest V3 and should work in:
- Chrome 88+
- Firefox 60+
- Edge 79+
- Other Chromium-based browsers

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements that could be added:
